This notes are for my project of the Artificial Intelligence subject of
Universidad EAFIT.

Lastly updated August 20, 2020.

* Mathematical Model
The model will be implemented in =julia 1.4.2=, with a personal fork of the
=Fuzzy= package. This fork can be founded in [[https://github.com/juanscr/Fuzzy.jl][juanscr's github.]] After installing
it, just
#+begin_src julia
using Fuzzy
#+end_src

** Input Variables
There are three input variables.
- The /level of attention/ (ATT) in class is the level of attention of a
  student. This will help measure the attention that a student has in class and
  therefore have a measurement about their mental status. The level of attention
  is measured between $\mathrm{ATT} \in [0, 5]$. The membership functions are
#+begin_src julia
input_att = Dict{String, Fuzzy.MF}("Low" => SigmoidMF(-5, 1.7, 0), "Average" => GaussianMF(2.5, 0.7), "High" => SigmoidMF(5, 3.3, 5))
#+end_src
Each function plotted can be seen in the following image:

[[./figs/att.png]]

- The /academic performance/ (AP) is the measurement of the notes that the
  student has. This is measured by the average of all their notes, therefore it
  is measured between $\mathrm{AP} \in [0, 5]$. The memberships functions are
#+begin_src julia
input_ap = Dict{String, Fuzzy.MF}("Low" => BellMF(1.5, 4, 0), "Average" => GaussianMF(3, 0.7), "High" => BellMF(1, 4, 5))
#+end_src
Each function plotted can be seen in the following image:

[[./figs/ap.png]]

- The /emotional socialization/ (ES) is the measurement of how the student
  shares his negative emotions with those who surround them. There are several
  indicators to measure this variable, as seen in [2]. Therefore, the selected
  measurement was the one done by Fabes [1], which can evaluate negative
  emotional socialization. This variable is measured between $\mathrm{ES} \in
  [-252, 252]$. The membership functions are:
#+begin_src julia
input_es = Dict{String, Fuzzy.MF}("Low Distress" => SigmoidMF(-0.05, -126, -252), "Mean Distress" => GaussianMF(0, 70), "High Distress" => SigmoidMF(0.05, 126, 252))
#+end_src
Each function plotted can be seen in the following image:

[[./figs/es.png]]

** Output Variables
The output variables are the level of /depression/, /anxiety/ and
/hyperactivity/. This where selected based on [3] and [4] which show the
importance of measuring this variables in students to prevent several causes.
Each level will be measured between $[0, 100]$ so the output of the system is a
percentage resembling the level of each output.

All the outputs have the same categories and functions. This are given by:

** Rules
If the ATT is low *and* AP is low *and* ES is low then
- /depression/ is high.
- /anxiety/ is high.
- /hyperactivity/ is high.

If the ATT is low *and* AP is low *and* ES is medium then
- /depression/ is high.
- /anxiety/ is low.
- /hyperactivity/ is high.

If the ATT is low *and* AP is low *and* ES is high then
- /depression/ is low.
- /anxiety/ is low.
- /hyperactivity/ is high.

If the ATT is low *and* the AP is medium *and* ES is low then
- /depression/ is high.
- /anxiety/ is low.
- /hyperactivity/ is high.

If the ATT is low *and* the AP is medium *and* ES is medium then
- /depression/ is low.
- /anxiety/ is low.
- /hyperactivity/ is high.

If the ATT is low *and* the AP is high *and* ES is low then
- /depression/ is high.
- /anxiety/ is low.
- /hyperactivity/ is high.

If the ATT is low *and* AP is not high *and* ES is low then
- /depression/ is high.
- /anxiety/ is high.
- /hyperactivity/ is low.

If the ATT is medium *and* AP is low *and* ES is low then
- /depression/ is high.
- /anxiety/ is low.
- /hyperactivity/ is low.

If the ATT is high *and* the AP is low *and* ES is medium then
- /depression/ is low.
- /anxiety/ is low.
- /hyperactivity/ is high.

If the ATT is high *and* the AP is low *and* ES is low then
- /depression/ is high.
- /anxiety/ is low.
- /hyperactivity/ is low.

If the ATT is high *and* the AP is high *and* the ES is not low then
- /depression/ is low.
- /anxiety/ is high.
- /hyperactivity/ is low.

If the ATT is high *and* the AP is high *and* the ES is high then
- /depression/ is low.
- /anxiety/ is low.
- /hyperactivity/ is low.

If the ATT is high *and* the AP is not low *and* the ES is high then
- /depression/ is low.
- /anxiety/ is low.
- /hyperactivity/ is low.

The rules are read by a function from this file. The function is
#+begin_src julia
function read_rules(number_of_outputs :: Int64)
    # Open org mode file
    file = read(open("../notes/notes.org", "r"), String)
    file_sp = split(file, "**")

    # Find string with rules
    rules_s = Nothing
    for section in file_sp
        if section[2:6] == "Rules"
            rules_s = section
            break
        end
    end

    # Separate all rules
    rules = split(replace(rules_s, " Rules\n" => ""), "\n\n")

    # Create output list
    outputs = []
    for i in 1:number_of_outputs
        push!(outputs, [])
    end

    # Process each rule
    possibilities = r"(not )?(low|medium|high)"
    for rule in rules
        if (rule[1:2] != "If")
            return outputs
        end
        inputs = []

        aux = split(rule, " is ")
        for i in 2:(length(aux) - number_of_outputs)
            match0 = match(possibilities, aux[i]).match
            if match0 == "low"
                match0 = "Low"
            elseif match0 == "medium"
                match0 = "Average"
            else
                match0 = "High"
            end
            push!(inputs, match0)
        end

        for i in (length(aux) - number_of_outputs + 1):length(aux)
            match0 = match(possibilities, aux[i]).match
            if match0 == "low"
                match0 = "Low"
            elseif match0 == "medium"
                match0 = "Average"
            else
                match0 = "High"
            end
            push!(outputs[i + number_of_outputs - length(aux)], Rule(inputs, match0))
        end
    end

    return outputs
end
